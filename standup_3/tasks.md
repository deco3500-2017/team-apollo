# Design Prototype Tasks
- Get a large part of prototype developed to Hi-Fi enough degree that we can start translating them to the functional prototype's UI.
- Work with Jenna to help her create a user testing plan.

# User Testing Tasks
- Work with the design prototype guys to develop a user testing plan.
- Need to consider some other design aspects of the appliction to help us get more marks, an example to ullustrate: The tutors mentioned that we'll get more marks if our prototype demonstrates understanding of the lecture content so we need to for example have some functions or features to the prototype that demonstrate how we're planning on reaching critical mass, etc. So we shouldn't just be thinking about designing the simple "Features" but also the other functions of the app that match some of the more complex lecture content otherwise we're going to lose a lot of marks... Another example I can think of off the top of my head is to design the screens which communicate to the user how they're looking for their privacy.

#User testing plan 
- instruction before user testing 
The observer needs to provid with more detailed instructions about the testing tasks they are going to perform
Mentioned about how long they will be involove in this task ï¼ˆfor example 10 - 15 minutes) 
Encourage them to give any comment and think out loud while they interact with the product 

- observation task
The user will be interact with the prototype while we guide them with the following tasks. And we need to guide them when any difficulties happen.
