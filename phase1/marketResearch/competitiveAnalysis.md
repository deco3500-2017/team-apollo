# Competitive Analysis

## Looop

The following competitive analysis will aim to uncover aspects of the Looop application. These aspects will be discussed, and analysed whether they are an opportunity, threats or weaknesses within the application. Opportunities would be seen as learnings that the Venu team could apply to their implementation, while threats are features that would be difficult to implement, and seen as some type of competitive advantage.

These aspects include the following:

- Real-time activity within Venues
- Facebook Registration
- Recommended Venues
- Favourite Venues
- Watch Venues
- 360 degree Photographs
- Map/List View
- Search for Venues (by current activity or type)
- Order an Uber/Lyft through the app
- Request a new venue

### Real-time activity within Venues

The exact nature of this feature is unclear, however, it is being advertised that the developers have installed some type of sensor within each venue to gather and deliver real-time information on the activity of a venue. So, while this does seem like one of the best ways to gather the most relevant information - it begs the question of application scale.

### Facebook Registration

To begin using the application, the user must either register through the Looop registration process, or use Facebook to register. Facebook registration obviously allows the application to collect very useful information about the users.

### Recommend Venues

The application will recommend a venue to the user each time they enter the application. The algorithm behind this is unclear, but it would be fair to assume it would learn over time.

### Favourite Venues

Users can proactively favourite venues that they have enjoyed visiting, this would allow the application to become even more accurate with relevant recommendations.

### Watch Venues

Watching venues is another proactive user feature whereby the user can hit watch on a venue and will be notified regularly on it's current activity level. Some extensions upon this feature could be to include a "Notify me when the venue hits X activity level".

### 360 Degree Photographs

Due to the nature of the real-time activity systems, it is clear that the application must create a business relationship with any participating venues. Clearly the developers used this relationship to also gather highly useful and crisp 360 photographs of all venues for the users convenience.

### Map/List View

Users can view venues that are currently active through the map or list venue which gives them snap shot information of what they are offering.

### Search for venues

Users can search for specific venues or broadly search with filters that look at the current activity of a venue and the specific type of venue.

### Order an Uber/Lyft through the app

A feature that can selected within a venue, whereby you can quickly order transport to the venue you are currently viewing.

### Request a new venue

A feature that gives control to the users and allows them to request new venues to be added within their city.
