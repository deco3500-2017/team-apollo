## Introduce yourself to the participant

## Explain the project and purpose for this interview
The purpose of this research is to gather data about the requirements our users would have of an application that is being developed by us. The application is intended to help people make informed decisions about which social venue is best to go to, based on real-time live reviews and data about all the surrounding venues. We will be using this data to determine what a user such as yourself would and wouldn't value in the final version of the application. We are recording you today while we interview simply to keep a more accurate record of your responses, which we will transcribe later, and the footage will be deleted afterwards.

You may ask us to stop the interview at any time. You may take as long as you like to respond. I'll start with a few questions about yourself and then we'll get into the more important questions about your experiences with social venues. Do you have any questions before we begin?

## Interview questions

- Do you go to social venues often? ; What day and time do you tend to go? ; Who do you go with?

Response : I would say moderate to low in terms of how often. I go with my friends and it's always on fridays and saturdays.


- Do you think that there's any potential value to you in the project we're undertaking? ; Are there any specific features or ideas that may instantly come to mind when you think of using mobile technology to improve the current paradigm of going on a night out??

Response : Me personally I don't think it would be useful at all because i just follow people. How ever for my the more active it would be helpful to see the news feed of what your friends are doing to see what's POPPIN' 

you could have a map and see GPS marker of where people are at.

make sure the venues can't abuse it by faking how poppin' their place is... Especially while not too many people are using it


- Would you say that there are any clearly defined categories that you can put social venues into? ; What are the categories?

Response : Not politically correct ones.. Dancing, Mingling, Places for people to hook up - like places where you need a girl with you to get in, there could be more categories but hard to do with without stereotyping eg the met is different from TBC but both for dancing. ... Could try profile people for what demographic they are ...


- What type of words would you use to describe a venue that is fun? ; What type of words would you use to describe a venue which isn't fun?

Response : Can't think of any except for dank ... for not fun: Quiet, Relaxing ... Up Tight


- Is there anything you wish you could easily find out about a venue that may not be on their website or social media page?

Response : Ticket levels: how many tickets to they have left at the door. How long the line is. How close to capacity they are... Drinks on special, exactly what DJ is coming on & when.... 


- What is the key reason you tend to head to a venue is it to catch up with friends, meet new people, have new experiences, to unwind? Do you usually drink alcohol when you go out? How much of a factor would you say alcohol plays in your experience?

Response : definitely not relax.. Have new experiences, meet new people, dance, get drunk ... Alcohol is a gigantic factor for me and I would argue that it's gigantic for everyone in the valley. If they're not drunk they're on drugs or they're trying to get laid...


- Does the price of the venue play an important factor in your decision to go or your experience while there? This can be the price of entry, price of food or drinks, or more. 

Response : No... However it affects all my friends' decision making and therefore don't end up going. The group is only as strong as the poorest link in it.


- What's the most important thing in a venue to you? Do you find that venues with this thing tend to be more fun?

Response : A non-agressive dance floor.. an open dance floor.. and then a place far away from the music where you can talk without having to yell.. key thing is dancing but need to be able to have a rest.... 


- Could you describe your relationships with the people in any social venues you go frequently?

Response : I go out with my friends, we pretty much are making jokes or having deep conversations.. The strangers I meet I try to ask them about their life.. The staff are the enemy I always am getting in trouble from them.


- In what ways do you usually find social venues without recommendation from friends?

Response : If an artist I like is playing there.. Or we walk past it and it looks appealing.


- Tell me about a time when you recommended or shared a social venue with a friend, what did you do?

Response : Yes but my memory is fuzzy, it was just in casual conversation ... Recommended it because it was a cheap place with good atmosphere


- What do you expect from an application which is meant to help you to make a decision about which social venues to go to?

Response : profiles that cater the feed to who I am.. want the feed customised to what I would like. I would expect a friend system so that I can see through the randoms and see the people I know.. Although GPS would be weird to have people I don't like know where I am, would have to be optional so only the people I like can see me. A GPS featyre to see where everyone is clustering would be cool too.
