## Introduce yourself to the participant

## Explain the project and purpose for this interview
The purpose of this research is to gather data about the requirements our users would have of an application that is being developed by us. The application is intended to help people make informed decisions about which social venue is best to go to, based on real-time live reviews and data about all the surrounding venues. We will be using this data to determine what a user such as yourself would and wouldn't value in the final version of the application. We are recording you today while we interview simply to keep a more accurate record of your responses, which we will transcribe later, and the footage will be deleted afterwards.

You may ask us to stop the interview at any time. You may take as long as you like to respond. I'll start with a few questions about yourself and then we'll get into the more important questions about your experiences with social venues. Do you have any questions before we begin?

## Interview questions

- Do you go to social venues often? ; What day and time do you tend to go? ; Who do you go with?

Response :
No not often. Average twice to three times per month... Usually go out saturday night and will be leaving at about 11pm. I go with close friends, who I know from school.


- Do you think that there's any potential value to you in the project we're undertaking? ; Are there any specific features or ideas that may instantly come to mind when you think of using mobile technology to improve the current paradigm of going on a night out??

Response : I think it would benefit me because I have a lot of friends who I don't keep in contact with but if I knew where they were on a night out i'd be inclined to visit them. It would be nice to know what type of music the venue is playing on a particular night.. And how much it will cost to get in. Drink prices would be awesome too.. Even a menu!


- Would you say that there are any clearly defined categories that you can put social venues into? ; What are the categories?

Response : Clubs that play dance music, and you go there because you want to dance. Bars where you go just to chill and to drink, hanging out is the main thing to do in these places. Live music venues but not sure if it's relevant.


- What type of words would you use to describe a venue that is fun? ; What type of words would you use to describe a venue which isn't fun?

Response : Playing music that I like.. If I can talk to people it's cool. Social.


- Is there anything you wish you could easily find out about a venue that may not be on their website or social media page?

Response : What type of music they're playing right now.. Band or DJ or what?? Drink prices.. Happy Hour times.. Opening hours, probably on facebook though. Entry Prices...


- What is the key reason you tend to head to a venue is it to catch up with friends, meet new people, have new experiences, to unwind? Do you usually drink alcohol when you go out? How much of a factor would you say alcohol plays in your experience?

Response : A bit of relaxation / release and to meet new people.. Girls specifically. Yes I do drink when I go out. It plays quite a large factor on my experience, alcohol is important when I go out. Wouldn't have as much fun if it wasn't for alcohol because it makes socialising easier.


- Does the price of the venue play an important factor in your decision to go or your experience while there? This can be the price of entry, price of food or drinks, or more.

Response : Yes.. I'm only going to go to a venue which charges entry if there's some type of event on there.. Don't usually know what's going on in these venues unless i've specifically looked it up or seen it on facebook etc. Price of drinks is really important too, if expensive i'd be likely to drink less and might make me unhappy. Ultimately wouldn't have a big impacton the overall night.


- What's the most important thing in a venue to you? Do you find that venues with this thing tend to be more fun?

Response : Somewhere to sit.. Quiet, away from the music so that I can talk to people. A good place to dance is important too but not necessarily in the same venue.


- Could you describe your relationships with the people in any social venues you go frequently?

Response : N/A


- In what ways do you usually find social venues without recommendation from friends?

Response : Facebook


- Tell me about a time when you recommended or shared a social venue with a friend, what did you do?

Response : Don't think it's ever happened


- What do you expect from an application which is meant to help you to make a decision about which social venues to go to?

Response : Would need a lot of data on a lot of venues otherwise it wouldn't truly be that useful.
