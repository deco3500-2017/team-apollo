## 3.0 Project Summary

_Venu_ is a project that intends to improve the quality of the community's nights when they go out to venues in their local city. Today there is currently no way of knowing which venue currently has the best atmosphere, in real-time, and making a decision based on that. The best people can currently do is simply choose from their favourite venues, or source information from friends or social media on any given night out, which is not reliable. By utilizing social and mobile technology in conjunction, _Venu_ will help people make a more informed decision before they out for the night.
