## 2.0 Prototype

**Live Prototype:** https://deco3500-venu.uqcloud.net

**Low-Fidelity Prototype:** https://invis.io/98E2N49TW

Note: The Functional Prototype is only compatible with iOS devices running iOS 11 and Safari, or Android devices running Chome 29 or newer.

To use the Functional Prototype you start by registering a user account with a simple username and password, and then signing in. Once signed in you are greeted with a message informing you that the application requires access to GPS, Microphone and Accelerometer sensors on your device. If the user chooses to continue their local device will ask for access, and if they are approved then the application will work as expected, (Note: The prototype has not been designed to handle cases where the required permissions are not granted, and undefined behaviour will occur in this case). The user will first get a glimpse of a map of Brisbane, with various circular markers placed on the map. Each of these markers has a dynamic aspect to them, which is that they will fill with a red colour as the Venue, denoted by that marker, has increasing Capacity, Movement and Volume readings, AKA the Venue's level of Buzz. For the sake of the prototype, all venues except for the REDROOM and the UQ 3500 Expo have simulated buzz ratings being created. If you tap on one of the markers, the assosciated venue's profile page will be displayed. This page features a breakdown of the Venue's current, real-time buzz, and other pertinent information such as the type of the venue, its opening hours, address and more. Exiting this screen, a user is also able to enter the list view (accessible via the leftmost navigation icon), which will display all of the venues and their buzz, ordered by geographic distance from the current user. The user can also access and account page where they can see recent, relevant activity on the Venu platform.

## 3.0 Project Summary

_Venu_ is a project that intends to improve the quality of the community's nights when they go out to venues in their local city. Today there is currently no way of knowing which venue currently has the best atmosphere, in real-time, and making a decision based on that. The best people can currently do is simply choose from their favourite venues, or source information from friends or social media on any given night out, which is not reliable. By utilizing social and mobile technology in conjunction, _Venu_ will help people make a more informed decision before they out for the night.
