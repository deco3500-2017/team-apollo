# Project Proposal: Venu

DECO3500: Social & Human Computing

Team Name: Team Apollo

## Introduction

(What is your project and what dilemma does it aim to address.)

_Venu_ is a project that intends to improve the quality of the community's nights when they go out to venues in their local city. Today there is currently no way of making an informed decision as to what locale or venue have the best atmosphere at the time people choose to go out. The best people can do currently is to choose from their favourite venues, or source information from friends or social media outlets on any given night out. By utilising social and mobile technology in conjunction, _Venu_ will help people make a more informed decision before they out for the night.

## Concept

(Outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and identify how your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings. Identify areas of social & mobile theory that apply to, will inform your concept & approach.)

_Venu_ intends to be a cross-platform mobile application that will offer its users a social experience that should create fun and unexpected nights out. Current large-scale social networks are disconnected from the real-time events, and other niche social network products such as Tinder and Meetup don't currently have a peer that allows people to view the quality of events around them in real-time.

The core concept of the service is to allow users access to a map that will give recommendations of venues that are currently trending in real-time. The ratings will be sourced through the utilisation of the _Instagram Story_ functionality which will be used to correlate the time of the post and the location it was posted. The logic here is that people, in mass, tend to post photos and videos on their _Instagram_ accounts when they are enjoying themselves. By sourcing crowd data, we are able to create what we call a _Buzz Level_ of a venue, and showcase this information to user's graphically.

### Role Details

#### Team Leader

The team leader is responsible for overseeing the project, assigning tasks among the group members and ensuring all group discussions and conflicts are handled appropriately. Further to this, it is their responsible to organise additional group meetings as necessary and ensuring all communications external to the group are managed.

#### Designer

Designers of the group handle the aesthetic and user experience side of the application. They will tend to spend most of their time working on the visual layout and aspects of the application. Their primary tools will be programs such as Sketch, Framer & Balsamiq for different project phases.

#### Software Developer

The assigned software developer within the group will take the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions made about that project are feasible from a technical stand point. This means understanding the possible implementations of the application, and considering the time and difficulty of these implementation, as well as whether it would be theoretically possible to build. The Software Developer will further be responsible for documenting how these features will be engineered, to go with the design documentation.

#### User Testing Specialist

The User Testing Specialist will be assigned with the role of handling all user facing issues of the application. This will include overseeing all user testing deliverables, handling any sessions required to get user feedback and collating and delivering the results from these sessions.

### Team Processes

#### Decision Making

It is generally expected that the team will discuss all decisions and organically come to a conclusion. Where a team member strongly disagrees with an option they may make a motion to have a conflict resolution activity. This activity will involve everyone in the team taking a few minutes each to deliver their key concerns and reasons for their decision. After team members are happy that they have delivered their point, the team will take a democratic vote on which decision to go with.

#### Poor Performance and Conflict Resolution

Where a team member feels that another member hasn't performed, they should privately discuss with the other team members or the team leader their concerns. If the member's come to agreement, they may decide to communicate with the offending team member to let them know that their work is falling behind. If no suitable remedy can be determined then the team may elect to have a Peer Assessment Factor introduced, by democratic vote.

## Communications

(Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate? Where will files 1 be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions? Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate communication and / or file sharing?)

The team will meet Tuesday every week between 12pm and 2pm, during the scheduled class workshop. During this time, team member's should raise any important developments they know of, or concerns they might have. The team may also elect to have secondary team meetings on Wednesdays between 2pm and 4pm, when all team members have proven to have free time, if it is deemed necessary. These secondary meetings will not happen by default, but only on specific weeks when the team feels it is necessary.

There are five team members, each of us will contribute at least 2 hours for discussing and planning the project development. It is crucial for us to meet at the beginning of each week to discuss three main questions: 1. How does the project progress going toward the project development goals last week. 2. What we plan for improving and developing the project this week. 3. Have we met any difficulties from last week? At the meeting the team leader aims to help each other to define the current process of project. The benefit of this meeting is to identify about “what’s went well”, “what stop us to continue” and “how we improve for next step.”

Attendance of team meetings is considered mandatory and important, except for when reasonable circumstances may arise. If the circumstances are not considered reasonable by the rest of the team then the Poor Performance and conflict resolution policies may be called upon.

### Slack

Slack will be the groups core method of communication and will be where the majority of outside-meeting communication will occur.

### Trello

Trello will be used within the project to assign and manage tasks. This will done by creating a task backlog that any of the group members can access at any time and assign themselves. These tasks will receive priorities and group members should aim to complete the most crucial tasks first.

### Email

Email will be used for all external-group and official course related communications. The _team leader_ will be responsible for this communication where possible, however other group members do have the ability to email outside of the group for project related reasons.

### Google Drive
The team will use Google Drive to collaboratively work on tasks where it is seen as appropriate. They may also use Google Drive's commenting feature as a method to discuss specific points within documents that are being written.

### Discord
Where team members may determine it is more effective to communicate via voice, in scenarios where team meetings aren't an option, they make use a discord channel to communicate. Key Decisions determined within these chats should be written down within the team's Google Drive Folder.

#### 5\. User Testing

In the first user testing procedure, the testing process will be divided into 5 steps.
1.	The user test will begin with a consent form for both the user and the tester to sign. (0-5 mins) 
2.	We will provide a pre-test interview for user to understand about what the purpose of our project and how long the test will take. (0-5mins)
3. 	The test task form will be prepared before the test, and the form will be provided for user to have a clearly follow list and help them to complete all the task. (5-10mins)
4.	After the user test, user needs to complete a post-test questionnaire form to provide their suggestion about the improvement of initial prototype.
5.	In the end, it is crucial for us to have a debrief time to evaluate and analysis the task form and the questionnaire form to improve the user experience.  

#### Participants

Around six or eight users will be recruited in the test plan. Each of them needs to take around 15 mins to complete the whole test tasks. We aim to invite university students as our main user as their activity and routine meet the goals of the product.

#### Location & Dates 
The first user testing location will be conducted at Room 109, building 78, Queensland of university at SEP 20.

#### Tools 
Good Drive will be the main tool for us to generate the questionnaire form which is convenient for user to fill.
