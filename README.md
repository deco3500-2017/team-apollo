## 2.0 Prototype

**Live Prototype:** https://deco3500-venu.uqcloud.net

**Low-Fidelity Prototype:** https://invis.io/98E2N49TW

Prototype Quick Steps: 
1. Start by registering a user account with a simple username and password, and then signing in. 
2. Grant access to GPS, Microphone and Accelerometer sensors on your device. (Note: The prototype has not been designed to handle cases where the required permissions are not granted, and undefined behaviour will occur in this case). 
3. Navigate the map. Each of the markers on the map represents a Venue. The marker will fill with a red colour as the Venue, has increasing Capacity, Movement and Volume readings, AKA the Venue's level of Buzz. (Note: all venues except for the REDROOM and the UQ 3500 Expo have simulated buzz ratings being created.)
4. Pick a venue to see it's profile page. This page features a breakdown of the Venue's current, real-time buzz, and other pertinent information.
5. You can also able to enter the list view (accessible via the leftmost navigation icon), which will display all of the venues and their buzz, ordered by geographic distance from your current location.

## 3.0 Project Summary

The problem space was trying to bridge the gap between patrons and the venues in their city. The best that a patron can currently do before heading out is either getting a good recommendation from a friend, going to multiple venues until they find the right one, or getting lucky, in search of the right atmosphere for a night out. This was addressed by trying to create a platform which allowed users to gather accurate and up-to-date information about all of the venues surrounding them, using the affordances of social and mobile technology. 

## 4.0 Project Process

### Phase 1: Research

#### Industry Research

Industry research was undertaken to look at the industry that Venu hopes to enter. This is about looking at the internal and external evironemnt of the industry and searching for opportunities or threats, potentially in the form of competitors. From this research we found that the industry had some want, with few actual resolutions in place for the specific problem. However, there were some competitors found, such as Looop (operating in New York), which allowed the team to learn about their experience in the industry and the angle they took.

#### Sketching & Wireframing

Wireframes are a low-fidelity, generalised version of the applications layout. They are created to test out of the functionality behaviour and priority of elements within the application. The goals of creating these prototypes is to allow for quick design iteration, as opposed to make similar changes to a high-fidelity prototype, which would be time expensive. This phase of the wireframing allowed the team to explore some arbitary ideas and concepts that could work, however, they were based off shallow assumptions at this stage.

#### Concerns: Privacy and Critical Mass
It was determined early on that Privacy and Critical mass would be two key issues for our project. Critical mass was a big problem because of the dependece of User-Generated reviews to rate venues by. Privacy would also be a concern because of the nature of knowing the time and location of where the users were, as well as how that fit together with some of the social aspects intended for the application. Our detailed discussion of these concerns can be found in section 2.3.4 in the original Project Proposal [Here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-apollo/blob/master/projectProposal/projectProposal.md).

### Phase 2: Requirements

#### Surveys, Interviews, User Testing
Early user research was done by both Survey and Interview methods. The ([form](https://husheng1.typeform.com/to/RnIZsO)) form of the survey was generated using an online tool, TypeForm, and was made up of 22 quantitative and qualitative ([questions](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-apollo/blob/master/phase1/userResearch/surveyQuestions.md)) and were possed to the social network of the group. The key goal of this early research was to get an understanding of the habits of Nightlife Patrons, what they valued, disliked, and they key feelings about certain aspects of nightlife. This research provided a wealth of information regarding our users and has been visually broken down in the following poster.    Â

#### Wireframing

Through the research undertaken as part of the research and requirements gathering phases, an improved level of wireframing was able to complete and let the team create an early prototype to perform user testing on. These designs were created using Balsamiq as a test for the possible form of the application and can be found [here](https://marvelapp.com/6f8aaia/screen/33069368).

### Phase 3: Design

#### Data-Collection Pivot

Early stages of the project outlined a data-collection method that was dependant on the user manual input data. During the early design phases and testing, we began to release this was potentially cumbersome and a burden to the user. As a result, the group began exploring ideas around passive collecting data through external sources (such as Instagram), as well as features native to mobile devices such as the microphone and accelerometer. However, as a result of this, greater concerns began to arise around privacy within the project and what we would actually be collecting, these concerns can be found [here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-apollo/blob/master/phase3/privacy.md). However, the issue of critical-mass was reduced as a result of passively collecting data and relying less on user input.

#### Brand & Style Guide

The projects style guide is a document that outlines the choices of colour, structure and typography to be used within the project. The benefit of creating this style guide was to give the designers a platform to have a defined set of styles to apply to the application as we moved from Wireframing through to Low-Fidelity designs. The style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-apollo/blob/master/phase2/styleGuide.md).

#### Low-Fidelity Designs & Invision Prototyping

A set of low-fidelity designs were created using Sketch to translate the function that had been proposed for the application into an aethsical piece of work that could be communicated to the user. Once a set of designs were agreed upon, they were translatted into a static prototype using Invision, which can be found [here](https://invis.io/98E2N49TW).

### Phase 4: Prototyping

The next stage of the prototype involved starting construction of a live, web-based prototype. The team pivoted to a functional prototype rather than one using the Framer prototyping software. To accomodate this late pivot, the team decided to let two members focus on building the backend, which would be agnostic to the finalised UI, while the rest of the team continued to develop the visual style of the application, and explore other features. Once designs were complete, the frontend UI was laid onto the backend logic.
