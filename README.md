# Project Proposal: Venu
DECO3500: Social & Human Computing

Team Name: Team Apollo

## Introduction
(What is your project and what dilemma does it aim to address.)

The Venu project intends to improve the quality of people's nights when they go out to venues in their city. Today there is currently no way of making an educated guess as to what venues have the best atmosphere at the time people choose to head out. The best people can do is choose from one of their favourites and hope that it's a good night out. By utilising social and mobile technology in conjunction, Venu hopes to help people make a more informed decision before they head out for the night.

##Tags
(Tag your proposed idea with 5 key concepts from social and mobile lectures (e.g. awareness,
Collaboration, CSCW) and 2 keywords related to your domain.)


## Concept
(outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and identify how
your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings. Identify areas of social & mobile theory
that apply to, will inform your concept & approach.)

Venu's value lies in its use of social and mobile technologies to create fun, unexpected experiences in the real world. Current large-scale social networks are disconnected from the real-world events, and other niche social network products such as tinder and meetup don't currently have a peer that allows people to view the quality of events around them in real-time. The concept of the service is to allow people to provide real-time ratings of the events and venues they're at right now. The real-time rating of these events will allow people from the wider community to make an informed decision about where to head. Linking an emoji or mood to the rating will help people understand what type of atmosphere is at the event, for example a busy EDM gig would have a mood associated with bright lights and loud sounds, whereas a jazz venue might be linked to a more relaxed mood rating. By allowing users to connect with their friends from other social networks within the app, they may share their current ratings and activities with friends, which may lead to exciting conversations and real-world meet ups.
