# Project Proposal: Venu

DECO3500: Social & Human Computing

Team Name: Team Apollo

## 1.0 Introduction

(What is your project and what dilemma does it aim to address.)

_Venu_ is a project that intends to improve the quality of the community's nights when they go out to venues in their local city. Today there is currently no way of making an informed decision as to what locale or venue have the best atmosphere at the time people choose to go out. The best people can do currently is to choose from their favourite venues, or source information from friends or social media outlets on any given night out. By utilizing social and mobile technology in conjunction, _Venu_ will help people make a more informed decision before they out for the night.

## 2.0 Concept

(Outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and identify how your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings. Identify areas of social & mobile theory that apply to, will inform your concept & approach.)

The core concept of the service is to allow users access to a map that will give ratings of venues in real-time. The ratings will be based on two key metrics: _Buzz_ and _Vibe_. A Venue's _Buzz_ will have three qualities that are displayed to a user, determined by passively gathering data about that venue in real time. These three qualities will be Popularity, Movement, and Sound. Popularity will be determined based on how many users are at the venue at once, Movement will be determined by measurements of user's device accelerometers, and Sound will be determined based on the decibel reading of user's microphones. _Vibe_ will be manually input by our users, where they will have the ability to input atmosphere specific icons or phrases such as 'Loud', 'Social', 'Relaxed' etc..

By viewing a Venue's Buzz and Vibe, a user should be able to make an accurate decision as to whether the Venue in question will provide the type of experience they're looking for. The idealized value of the app is that it will save its users time and money spent hopping between venues, as well as allowing them to experience new things and have more fun on their nights out. Venu will provide a new experience for its users also because there is not currently any similar service that would provide the same type of information to users. Review platforms such as Google, Yelp and Facebook don't provide any real time data which renders them useless to the patrons Venu is targeting. This is obvious because a Venue's atmosphere changes from hour to hour, which could not possibly be indicated by a long-term 5-star rating; a 5-star rating also does nothing to indicate the type of music, crowd, or atmosphere at a venue, which is what a patron really cares about.

### 2.1 Audience

The audience of the app will be patrons of nightclubs and other entertainment venues. The demographics of these users will tend to be people between the ages of 18 and 30, socio-economically spanning the lower to upper-middle class.

#### 2.1.1 User Persona : Paul
**Age:** 21

**Location:** Kangaroo Point, Brisbane, Queensland

**Education:** Brisbane State High School

**Occupation:** Paul is a student at QUT in Brisbane, Queensland, studying a Bachelor in Sport & Exercise Science.

**Personality & History:**
* Paul loves hanging out with friends and having new experiences.
* He went to University directly after high school.
* Paul has been going to parties and nightclubs frequently since he turned 18\.

**Goals:**
* Paul wants to experience new things and make great memories with his friends while he is young.
* Paul and his friends specifically love going to nightclubs which have a DJ who is really getting the crowd going.

**Frustrations:**
* Paul finds that his nights out can be hit-and-miss.
* Paul hates spending $20 on the entry-fee for a night club if it isn't fun inside.
* Paul doesn't like sending messages out to all the people he knows to see if they're at a good club.

### 2.2 Aim

The aim of the project is to provide a platform that lets users feel more empowered and knowledgable before they make a decision about which venue to go to on a night out. Venu can be considered a success if it achieves this, and builds a loyal base of users who value its features.

### 2.3 Background Theory, Context and Considerations

#### 2.3.1 Requirements Gathering
Interviews will be the primary method for requirements gathering. Interviews have been determined as the best way to gather requirements because of the rich information that can be gathered, while connecting directly with the users as stakeholders. The context of an interview will allow the interviewer to probe the interviewee when they hint at a valuable piece of information which we may not have otherwise considered. An interview is a better way to probe for this type of information than other methods which could present that same information, such as direct observation in the wild, which would be hard to do in the context of observing users while they go out to venues at night.

The interviews will contain both qualitative and quantitative questions to gather a variety of information about the field in question. Quantitative questions should be closed-ended and used to gather important factual information, such as: How many venues do they think they tend to go through on an average night out, how many venues would they consider to be too many to go through in one night, how much time they would be willing to spend deciding where to go before they head out, etc. The qualitative questions should be open-ended, trying to get an indication of what a user values from a night out. Using these open-ended questions we want to determine key points such as: what are all of the key factors about a venue that will impact on its quality, how many and what categories would you say that a venue could fall into, what language would you use to describe a good venue, etc.

#### 2.3.2 Methods for testing the Concept

#### 2.3.3 Model of Context

The context of the application is that it will be installed on a user's mobile device. This means that the product will be freely mobile, and personally attached to the user at all times, while maintaining communication with the service's backend all the time via a mobile network. As a virtue of the mobile device it is installed on the product will be aware of its location at all times, and it will also be able to use the device's sensors such as its microphone and accelerometer to gather information. The product will allow the user to perform specific tasks for the user, in this case viewing time and location specific information, in a quick and personally driven manner. The user will be aware that the information being provided is a real-time measurement, and constantly in flux.

#### 2.3.5 Other Design Considerations

##### Privacy

A key consideration that will have to be considered throughout development would be that of privacy. There are two key areas where this privacy concern will present itself:

**1. Privacy within their social network.**

The product is going to have a social aspect to it to encourage users to share their good experiences and reviews. It is known that users of social media networks are comfortable doing this, however there is a line when they feel that sharing this information gives away too much information. An example of this is that users of Snapchat are generally comfortable sharing photos or videos of themselves in a clearly defined location at a clearly defined time, however a lot of users had a problem with Snapchat's SnapMaps feature, feeling that it gave away too much information by sharing their location in real-time. From these two observations it can be deduced that there is a certain cut-off point where a user feels uncomfortable sharing their location with too high of a resolution. Therefore the Venu application should be mindful of this when providing features which may potentially give away a user's location when used.

**2. The service breaching the user's privacy**

Users of online services consider their privacy important. It is clearly documented that users dislike giving access to their devices peripherals, such as cameras and other sensors, however they are usually willing to make a concession based on the value that the service is providing them. For this reason, Venu needs to make it clear to a user that any access to the microphone and accelerometer required is done in a way that does not possibly breach their privacy, and the features they enable must be of value to the users.

### 3.1 Role Details

#### 3.1.1 Team Leader

The team leader is responsible for overseeing the project, assigning tasks among the group members and ensuring all group discussions and conflicts are handled appropriately. Further to this, it is their responsible to organise additional group meetings as necessary and ensuring all communications external to the group are managed.

#### 3.1.2 Designer

Designers of the group handle the aesthetic and user experience side of the application. They will tend to spend most of their time working on the visual layout and aspects of the application include front end design and build. Their primary tools will be programs such as Sketch, Framer & Balsamiq for different project phases.

#### 3.1.3 Software Developer

The assigned software developer within the group will take the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions made about that project are feasible from a technical stand point. This means understanding the possible implementations of the application, and considering the time and difficulty of these implementation, as well as whether it would be theoretically possible to build. The software developer will response for back end build and assist front end build. The Software Developer will further be responsible for documenting how these features will be engineered, to go with the design documentation.

#### 3.1.4 User Testing Specialist

The User Testing Specialist will be assigned with the role of handling all user facing issues of the application. This will include arrange test sessions, invite participant, and overseeing all user testing deliverables, handling any sessions required to get user feedback and collating and delivering the results from these sessions.

### 3.2 Team Processes

#### 3.2.1 Decision Making

It is generally expected that the team will discuss all decisions and organically come to a conclusion. Where a team member strongly disagrees with an option they may make a motion to have a conflict resolution activity. This activity will involve everyone in the team taking a few minutes each to deliver their key concerns and reasons for their decision. After team members are happy that they have delivered their point, the team will take a democratic vote on which decision to go with.

#### 3.2.2 Poor Performance and Conflict Resolution

Where a team member feels that another member hasn't performed, they should privately discuss with the other team members or the team leader their concerns. If the member's come to agreement, they may decide to communicate with the offending team member to let them know that their work is falling behind. If no suitable remedy can be determined then the team may elect to have a Peer Assessment Factor introduced, by democratic vote.

## 4.0 Communications

(Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate? Where will files 1 be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions? Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate communication and / or file sharing?)

The team will meet Tuesday every week between 12pm and 2pm, during the scheduled class workshop. During this time, team member's should raise any important developments they know of, or concerns they might have. The team may also elect to have secondary team meetings on Wednesdays between 2pm and 4pm, when all team members have proven to have free time, if it is deemed necessary. These secondary meetings will not happen by default, but only on specific weeks when the team feels it is necessary.

There are five team members, each of us will contribute at least 2 hours for discussing and planning the project development. It is crucial for us to meet at the beginning of each week to discuss three main questions: 1\. How does the project progress going toward the project development goals last week. 2\. What we plan for improving and developing the project this week. 3\. Have we met any difficulties from last week? At the meeting the team leader aims to help each other to define the current process of project. The benefit of this meeting is to identify about "what's went well", "what stop us to continue" and "how we improve for next step."

Attendance of team meetings is considered mandatory and important, except for when reasonable circumstances may arise. If the circumstances are not considered reasonable by the rest of the team then the Poor Performance and conflict resolution policies may be called upon.

### 4.1 Slack

Slack will be the groups core method of communication and will be where the majority of outside-meeting communication will occur.

### 4.2 Email

Email will be used for all external-group and official course related communications. The _team leader_ will be responsible for this communication where possible, however other group members do have the ability to email outside of the group for project related reasons.

### 4.3 Google Drive (File storage & share Method)

The team will use Google Drive to collaboratively work on tasks where it is seen as appropriate. They may also use Google Drive's commenting feature as a method to discuss specific points within documents that are being written. Google drive will be the group main method for store and share files, there will be several folders for Organise and distinguish different files, include user testing folder, prototype folder, research folder, code folder, back-up folder etc.

#### 4.3.1 Naming convention

The file naming convention will be used for organise and identify the files, the naming convention for every files (include code files) will follow this structure: Time**FileName**PersonName__Version Number. The files with a naming convention provide a preview of the content, are organized in a logical way identify the responsible party and convey the work history

### 4.4 Discord

Where team members may determine it is more effective to communicate via voice, in scenarios where team meetings aren't an option, they make use a discord channel to communicate. Key Decisions determined within these chats should be written down within the team's Google Drive Folder.

##### Low Fidelity User Testing

In the first user testing procedure, the testing process will be divided into 5 steps.

1. The user test will begin with a consent form for both the user and the tester to sign. (0-5 mins)
2. We will provide a pre-test interview for user to understand about what the purpose of our project and how long the test will take. (0-5mins)
3. The test task form will be prepared before the test, and the form will be provided for user to have a clearly follow list and help them to complete all the task. (5-10mins)
4. After the user test, user needs to complete a post-test questionnaire form to provide their suggestion about the improvement of initial prototype.(0-5mins)
5. In the end, it is crucial for us to have a debrief time to evaluate and analysis the task form and the questionnaire form to improve the user experience.

###### Participants

Around six or eight users will be recruited in the test plan. Each of them needs to take around 15 mins to complete the whole test tasks. We aim to invite university students as our main user as their activity and routine meet the goals of the product.
