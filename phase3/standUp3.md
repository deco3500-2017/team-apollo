-# Design Prototype Tasks
- Get a large part of prototype developed to Hi-Fi enough degree that we can start translating them to the functional prototype's UI.
- Work with Jenna to help her create a user testing plan.

# User Testing Tasks
- Work with the design prototype guys to develop a user testing plan.
- Need to consider some other design aspects of the appliction to help us get more marks, an example to ullustrate: The tutors mentioned that we'll get more marks if our prototype demonstrates understanding of the lecture content so we need to for example have some functions or features to the prototype that demonstrate how we're planning on reaching critical mass, etc. So we shouldn't just be thinking about designing the simple "Features" but also the other functions of the app that match some of the more complex lecture content otherwise we're going to lose a lot of marks... Another example I can think of off the top of my head is to design the screens which communicate to the user how they're looking for their privacy. **EDIT** Lorna says that Critical Mass and Privacy will be the two biggest concerns for our concept so we **NEED** to implement
